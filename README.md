# ðŸ’¤ LazyVim

A Neovim configuration based on [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim).

In Catalonia, we have a proverb: "Qui no tÃ© feina, el gat pentina", which translates to "Those who have no work, brush the cat". This means that when someone is idle or has nothing to do, they may engage in trivial or unnecessary tasks, similar to the idea of "idle hands are the devil's workshop."

I guess sometimes Neovim is like my cat to brush.

Refer to the [LazyVim documentation](https://lazyvim.github.io/installation) to learn how to start brushing your own feline.
